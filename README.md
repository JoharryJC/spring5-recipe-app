# Spring Recipe App

In this application I have used Spring Framework 5 and IntelliJ DEA, 
to demostrate the uses of this technology.  
You only should run this application and put http://localhost:8080/, 
This application is using H2 memory for saving data. You can access  
to http://localhost:8080/h2-console/  (jdbc:h2:mem:testdb) and look at 
the db structure and data here. I have used controllers, services, 
domains, repositories, commands and converters and I have created some 
classes for testing the code with JUnit and mockito.
